This code probably isn't of the best quality; I wrote it in middle school. Nor is it up to date, as I
probably made changes in the Apps Script editor afterwards. It was nevertheless an interesting experiment
with Google Apps Script, prompted by our school system's new Google Apps for Education program.

I'm not sure what the link was for (there was also a Chrome app), but the relevant scripts stopped 
working long ago anyway...

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page.

**Currently, it's only for the fcpsschools.net domain,** which is unsurprisingly, only for students in 
Fairfax County Public Schools whose schools are participating in Google Apps.

#summary How to install App Chat.

The current version is available as a *[http://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome] app only*, sorry other browsers!
  # Make sure that you have filled out [http://goo.gl/ZYlRo the form] to sign up first.
  # [http://app-chat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chrome.crx Install the app] in Google Chrome, and click Continue and whatever
  # Open the app by clicking its icon on the New Tab Page (press Ctrl+T)
  # Click "Log in with your fcpsschools.net account" and watch the magic happen.

Er, if stuff doesn't work try refreshing, or email me at gengkev@gmail.com or 1390276@fcpsschools.net, or however else you want to contact me, I don't care.

I suspect Google or FCPS will kick me out of this soon enough :P

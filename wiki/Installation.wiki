#summary How to install App Chat.

The current version is available as a *Chrome app*, sorry other browsers!
  # Make sure that you have filled out the form at http://goo.gl/ZYlRo
  # [http://app-chat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chrome.crx Install the app] in Google Chrome, and click Continue and whatever
  # Open the app on the new tab page or by [chrome-extension://ggkljdbenejolgnpgfgkppamiokbhcmj/index.html clicking here]
  # Click "Log in with your fcpsschools.net account" and watch the magic happen.

Er, if stuff doesn't work try refreshing, or email me at gengkev@gmail.com or 1390276@fcpsschools.net, or however else you want to contact me, I don't care.

I suspect Google or FCPS will kick me out of this soon enough :P
